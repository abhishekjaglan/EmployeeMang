# NestJS-REST API
## RESTful API that manages employees of an organisation and performs all CRUD operations.

Built this API during my learning process of NestJS. It uses following components:
- Modules, Controllers, Providers
- DTOs, Validation, and Pipes
- Prisma ORM for Neon Postgres database
- CORS, Rate Limitting, Servers logs, and Exception Filters
